# Awesome Research Software Engineering FAIR [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated awesome list of FAIR topics for Research Software Engineering (RSE). Inspired by [these curated collections](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). Topics cover citation and licensing of RS, metadata for RS, publication of RS, registries and repositories for RS, and search engines to find RS.
